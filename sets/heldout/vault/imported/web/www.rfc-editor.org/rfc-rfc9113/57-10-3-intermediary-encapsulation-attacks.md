HPACK permits encoding of field names and values that might be treated as delimiters in other HTTP versions. An intermediary that translates an HTTP/2 request or response MUST validate fields according to the rules in [Section 8.2](#HttpHeaders) before translating a message to another HTTP version. Translating a field that includes invalid delimiters could be used to cause recipients to incorrectly interpret a message, which could be exploited by an attacker.[¶](#section-10.3-1)

[Section 8.2](#HttpHeaders) does not include specific rules for validation of pseudo-header fields. If the values of these fields are used, additional validation is necessary. This is particularly important where "`:scheme`", "`:authority`", and "`:path`" are combined to form a single URI string \[[RFC3986](#RFC3986)]. Similar problems might occur when that URI or just "`:path`" is combined with "`:method`" to construct a request line (as in [Section 3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3) of \[[HTTP/1.1](#RFC9112)]). Simple concatenation is not secure unless the input values are fully validated.[¶](#section-10.3-2)

An intermediary can reject fields that contain invalid field names or values for other reasons -- in particular, those fields that do not conform to the HTTP ABNF grammar from [Section 5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5) of \[[HTTP](#RFC9110)]. Intermediaries that do not perform any validation of fields other than the minimum required by [Section 8.2](#HttpHeaders) could forward messages that contain invalid field names or values.[¶](#section-10.3-3)

An intermediary that receives any fields that require removal before forwarding (see [Section 7.6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.6.1) of \[[HTTP](#RFC9110)]) MUST remove or replace those header fields when forwarding messages. Additionally, intermediaries should take care when forwarding messages containing `Content-Length` fields to ensure that the message is [well-formed](#malformed) ([Section 8.1.1](#malformed)). This ensures that if the message is translated into HTTP/1.1 at any point, the framing will be correct.[¶](#section-10.3-4)
